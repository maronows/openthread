```

### start

Usage: `mqtt start [port]`

```

### stop

Usage: `mqtt stop`

* gateway-ip: IPv6 address of MQTT-SN gateway.
* gateway-port: Port number of MQTT-SN service.

```bash
> mqtt connect 2018:ff9b::ac12:8 10000
Done
connected
```

### reconnect

Usage: `mqtt reconnect`

Reconnect MQTT-SN client with current connection settings. This is method is useful e.g. for returning from sleep mode to active mode.

```bash
> mqtt reconnect
Done
connected
```

### subscribe

Usage: `mqtt subscribe <topic> [qos]`

Subscribe to the topic.

* topic: Name of the topic to subscribe.
* qos: Requested quality of service level for the topic. Possible values are 0, 1, 2, -1. Default value is 1 (optional).

Specific topic ID is returned after response. This ID is used for publising to the topic.

```bash
> mqtt subscribe sensors
Done
subscribed topic id: 1
```

### state

Usage: `mqtt state`

Get current state of MQTT-SN client.

```bash
> mqtt state
Disconnected
Done
```

### register

Usage: `mqtt register <topic>`

Register the topic.

* topic: Name of the topic to be registered.

Specific topic ID is returned after response. This ID is used for publising to the topic.

```bash
> mqtt register sensors
Done
registered topic id: 1
```

### publish

Usage: `mqtt publish <topic-id> [payload] [qos]`

Publish data to the topic. Data are encoded as string and white spaces are currentyl not supported (separated words are recognized as additional parameters).

* topic-id: ID of the topic. Can be obtained by [register](#register).
* payload: Text to be send in publish message payload. If empty, then empty data are send (optional).
* qos: Quality of service of publish. Possible values are 0, 1, or 2. Default value is 1 (optional).

```bash
> mqtt publish 1 {"temperature":24.0}
Done
published
```

### unsubscribe

Usage: `mqtt unsubscribe <topic>`

Unsubscribe from the topic.

* topic: Name of the topic to unsubscribe.

```bash
> mqtt unsubscribe sensors
Done
unsubscribed
```

### disconnect

Usage: `mqtt disconnect`

Disconnect from the gateway.

```bash
> mqtt disconnect
Done
disconnected reason: Client
```

### sleep

Usage: `mqtt sleep <duration>`

Take client to the sleeping state.

* duration: Sleep duration time in s.

```bash
> mqtt sleep 60
Done
disconnected reason: Asleep
```

### awake

Usage: `mqtt awake <timeout>`

Take client to the awake state from the sleeping state. In this state device can receive buffered messages from the gateway.

* timeout: Timeout in ms for whis is the client awake before going asleep.

```bash
> mqtt awake 1000
Done
connected
disconnected reason: Asleep
```

### searchgw

Usage: `mqtt searchgw <multicast-ip> <port> <radius>`

Send searchgw multicast message. If there is any MQTT-SN gateway listening in the same network it will answer with its connection details.

* multicast-ip: Multicast IPv6 address for spread the searchgw message.
* port: Destination port of MQTT-SN gateway.
* radius: Hop limit for multicast message.

```bash
> mqtt searchgw ff03::1 10000 5
Done
searchgw response from 2018:ff9b:0:0:0:0:ac12:8: gateway_id=1
```

If gateway is in the network behind border router forwarding for broadcast must be set.

### gateways

Get of active MQTT-SN gateways cached in the client. Gateways are periodically advertised or obtained with gwinfo message.

```bash
> mqtt gateways
gateway fd11:22:0:0:6648:fb52:b05:43f5: gateway_id=1
Done
```
